# LearnTerminal
A simple interactive text based tutorial of some basic terminal commands (written in bash). 
I wrote this as a tool to introduce new students in the lab to using a terminal.
To run you execute the main program(./LearnTerminal.sh). 
You may need to set the permissions of 'LearnTerminal.sh'. This is 'chmod u+x LearnTerminal.sh'
